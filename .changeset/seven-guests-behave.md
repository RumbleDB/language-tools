Rename `TypeInferencer` to `StaticTypeChecker` and return all static errors (`RumbleException`) in the `error` field of the body object. Previously, these errors were returned in the `error` field of the top-level response object. This made it difficult to distinguish between an exception from Java and a static type error from Rumble.
